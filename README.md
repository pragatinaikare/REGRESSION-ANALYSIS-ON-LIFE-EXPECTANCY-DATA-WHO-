# REGRESSION-ANALYSIS-ON-LIFE-EXPECTANCY-DATA-WHO

# Introduction

### GOAL
The primary goal of this project is to investigate and analyze the factors influencing life expectancy across 193 countries from the years 2000 to 2015. The aim is to construct robust regression models that encompass various critical variables, including immunization, mortality rates, economic indicators, social factors, and other health-related determinants. This analysis will contribute to understanding the relationships between these factors and life expectancy, facilitating insights into improving the average lifespan of populations globally.

### OBJECTIVE (Research Hypotheses)
- Build regression models to assess the impact of critical factors such as immunization, mortality rates, economic conditions, and social determinants on life expectancy.
- Provide insights and recommendations based on the findings to assist countries in identifying areas of focus to enhance their population's life expectancy effectively.
- Investigate the correlation between lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption), education (schooling), and population density with life expectancy.

### BACKGROUND
The study aims to investigate the factors affecting life expectancy across 193 countries by leveraging a comprehensive dataset sourced from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) under the World Health Organization (WHO). Past research primarily focused on demographic variables, income composition, and mortality rates, largely overlooking the impact of immunization and the Human Development Index (HDI). Furthermore, previous studies often utilized single-year data for all countries, lacking temporal depth. This project addresses these gaps, analyzing data spanning from 2000 to 2015 for all countries. Key immunization factors like Hepatitis B, Polio, and Diphtheria will be incorporated, alongside considerations for mortality, economic, social, and additional health-related factors. The objective is to uncover critical determinants influencing life expectancy, facilitating targeted improvements in public health interventions.
